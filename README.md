# Levels of Reality: A Journey to Quantum Time

An interactive educational visualization exploring the fundamental nature of time, from classical physics down to quantum foundations and back up through quantum gravity theories.

## 🌌 What Is This?

Journey through 16 levels of reality to discover what generates time itself:
- Start with the everyday mystery of ticking clocks
- Descend through quantum mechanics, fields, and entanglement
- Reach the foundation: quantum phase rotation
- Ascend through spacetime and competing quantum gravity theories
- Return with deeper understanding

**The answer:** Time emerges from quantum phase rotation—every particle is an internal clock.

## 🎯 Features

- **16 Interactive Levels**: From classical emergence to quantum gravity
- **Real-time Visualizations**: Canvas-based animations for each concept
- **Companion Explanations**: Deep dive into problem/idea/why/bridge for each level
- **Modern Physics**: Includes Standard Model, Noether's Theorem, String Theory, Loop Quantum Gravity, and Emergent Spacetime
- **Pedagogically Structured**: Detective-story approach, building intuition layer by layer
